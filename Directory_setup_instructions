Step 1:
Clone github repo with all EdSight data to local directory, add all files to a "Raw_from_GitHub" directory.
	~/Desktop/Data/EdSight/District/Raw_from_GitHub

Step 2:
Write mkdir script to create corresponding folders at same level as "Raw_from_GitHub" folder to house raw EdSight data:
	~/Desktop/Data/EdSight/District/mkdir.sh

Step 3: 
Run upload_raw.R script to copy files from EdSight folder to indiv dataset raw folders
	~/Desktop/Data/EdSight/District/upload_raw.R

Step 4:
Determine which datasets need to be separated out into categories. Clone ctdata-dataset-cookiecutter repo to local dataset directory:
	~/Desktop/Data/EdSight/District/Chronic-Absenteeism/ctdata-dataset-cookiecutter
Write individual cookiecutter.json files for each individal category:
	Example: ~/Desktop/Data/EdSight/District/Chronic-Absenteeism/ctdata-dataset-cookiecutter/cookiecutter.json
